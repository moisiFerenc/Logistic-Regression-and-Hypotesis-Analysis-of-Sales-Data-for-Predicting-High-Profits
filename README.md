# Europe Sales Records Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs analysis on the Europe Sales Records dataset available on Kaggle. The notebook explores various aspects of the dataset and utilizes logistic regression to predict high profits based on sales data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be found on Kaggle: [Europe Sales Records Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafabayar/europe-sales-records)

The dataset consists of sales records from European countries, including information such as region, country, item type, sales channel, order priority, order date, order ID, ship date, units sold, unit price, unit cost, total revenue, total cost, and total profit.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the dataset and performing initial exploration to understand its structure and contents.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, converting data types, and creating additional features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of various variables and identify patterns in the data.
4. Logistic Regression: Implementing logistic regression to predict high profits based on sales data, including model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing key findings and conclusions from the analysis.

## Requirements

To run the notebook locally, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
